## Running integration tests
Integration tests are located in a separate project for each cloud in the ```testing``` directory under the project root directory.

### Open API 3.0 - Swagger
- Swagger UI : https://host/context-path/swagger (will redirect to https://host/context-path/swagger-ui/index.html)
- api-docs (JSON) : https://host/context-path/api-docs
- api-docs (YAML) : https://host/context-path/api-docs.yaml

All the Swagger and OpenAPI related common properties are managed here [swagger.properties](./legal-core/src/main/resources/swagger.properties)

#### Server Url(full path vs relative path) configuration
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=true` It will generate full server url in the OpenAPI swagger
- `api.server.fullUrl.enabled=false` It will generate only the contextPath only
- default value is false (Currently only in Azure it is enabled)
